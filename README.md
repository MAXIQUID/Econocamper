# Subaru Scampback RV (SUV-Based Class B+)

This project outlines the design of a structural, SUV-based Class B+ recreational vehicle. The concept uses a Honda Passport as the base vehicle with a molded Scamp trailer body and Ram ProMaster rear suspension to form a unibody/monocoque-style RV.

## Goals

- True SUV-based camper with real highway capability
- Molded fiberglass body for durability and insulation
- Frame bolted to OEM bumper and roof for secure 5th wheel-style connection
- Maximize road worthiness, stability, and usable interior space

## Platform

- 2025 Honda Passport (FWD)
- Scamp trailer shell (modified)
- Ram ProMaster rear suspension
- Custom passthrough via sunroof

## Potentials

- Frame mounting design optimization using FEM
- Interior modular camper design with safety-first focus
- Aerodynamic enhancements to the Scamp shell
- All-season insulation study and HVAC integration

## Next Steps

- [ ] Draft mounting interface design for rear frame
- [ ] Develop fiberglass-to-steel joinery system
- [ ] Add layout mockups to `sketches/`
- [ ] Start structure simulation concepts in `docs/engineering/`
