# Structural RV Concept

## Concept

This RV hybrid uses a front-wheel-drive SUV platform (Honda Passport) as the towing and structural base, integrating a Scamp trailer shell directly into the unibody for structural rigidity.

## Design Features

- Rear bumper rebar used to bolt lower section of trailer body
- Upper section fixed to reinforced roof rails or custom exo-cage
- Sunroof removed or opened for access between cab and camper
- Interior based on Class B+ style layouts with modular furniture

## Safety Considerations

- Maintain crash zone logic of OEM platform
- Maintain full front SRS/airbag systems
- Ensure rollover resistance through CG optimization

## Potentials

- Full-scale prototype on donor Passport
- Use of marine-grade foam core floor
- Battery/inverter/micro-grid layout integration
